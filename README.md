# JsonWeaver
project is in /json_pro/

JsonWeaver is  a versatile Django-based application that provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing dynamic JSON endpoints. Similar to popular services like DummyJSON, it allows users to input custom JSON data and custom endpoint for that URL and generate unique URLs that serve the corresponding content. This makes it ideal for testing, prototyping, or even serving real-world JSON data in a dynamic and flexible manner.
